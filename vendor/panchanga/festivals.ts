/**
 * src/festivals.ts — the observance-rule EVALUATOR.
 *
 * Two responsibilities:
 *
 *  1. `selectDayByPervasion` — a PURE, independently-testable selection
 *     function. Given a set of candidate civil days (each with its tithi
 *     interval ∩ the day's kāla window, plus optional nakshatra / Bhadra
 *     facts), it applies the precedence policy, the nakshatra filter/tie-break,
 *     and records Bhadra overlap. No ephemeris, no I/O — the keystone logic the
 *     constructed-case tests target.
 *
 *  2. `computeFestival` / `computeFestivals` — resolve each `Observance.kind`
 *     to a civil date using the real astronomy modules (`time.ts`,
 *     `elements.ts`). These build the candidate set for `tithi-pervades` and
 *     feed it to `selectDayByPervasion`; the other kinds resolve directly.
 *
 * NEVER SILENTLY DROP: a rule that yields no date still returns a
 * `FestivalResult` (empty `date`) carrying a diagnostic, plus a top-level
 * diagnostic from `computeFestivals`.
 *
 * SCOPE: this is the MECHANISM (Task 5a). The per-festival rule DATA
 * (`src/rules.ts`) and the Drik-Panchang conformance gate are Task 5b/Phase 4.

 *      Bhadra-free candidate(s) standing, choose the Bhadra-free day on which
 *      the festival tithi is the UDAYA tithi (live at sunrise). This is the
 *      Drik resolution for Bhadra-excluded Pūrṇimā festivals: when the natural
 *      pradoṣa/aparāhna-vyāpinī day is Bhadra-contaminated, the observance
 *      shifts to the (next) udaya-Pūrṇimā day whose window is Bhadra-free, even
